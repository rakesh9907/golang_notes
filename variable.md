# Variables

- Go automatically maps int to int32 or int64 based on the value
    - var a int = 10

- Define String
    - var str string = "hello"

- Here define float variable according to value lenght two type of float type float32 and float64
    - var b float32 = 10.3

- Here define boolean variable
    - var isActive bool = false

## Short hand declaration ( this called inferred )
- Here short hand declartion
    - a := 10
    - str := "hello"

    - A float declared using short-hand syntax (:=) is automatically inferred as float64.
        - b := 10.5
    - isActive := false
